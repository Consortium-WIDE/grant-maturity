@article{brekke_hacker-engineers_2021,
	abstract = {Research by political economists typically highlights policymakers, regulators, economists and consultants as the makers of economies. This paper foregrounds a different actor entirely, what I call the `hacker-engineer' as an important protagonist in the making of decentralised digital network economies that are forged through the emerging field of `cryptoeconomics' and blockchain and other distributed ledger technologies. Responding to critical literature stating that blockchain and `cryptoeconomics' merely extend neoliberal processes of economisation, the paper recovers the neglected hacker culture of cypherpunk and histories of peer-to-peer decentralised networks in order to foreground concerns that depart from the continuation of economics and economies as usual. Hacker-engineers are dedicated to decentralisation as a `disruptive' response to network control and surveillance, and share a pragmatist sensibility that seeks to make decentralised networks `work' in order to provide informational security and privacy. While further broadening the range of agents that provide the focus for political economy research into the production of economies, the paper also draws attention to the technical decisions of hacker-engineers that attempt to reconfigure the material infrastructures of digital economies.},

@misc{wan_web3_2023,
	abstract = {Since the first appearance of the World Wide Web, people more rely on the Web for their cyber social activities. The second phase of World Wide Web, named Web 2.0, has been extensively attracting worldwide people that participate in building and enjoying the virtual world. Nowadays, the next internet revolution: Web3 is going to open new opportunities for traditional social models. The decentralization property of Web3 is capable of breaking the monopoly of the internet companies. Moreover, Web3 will lead a paradigm shift from the Web as a publishing medium to a medium of interaction and participation. This change will deeply transform the relations among users and platforms, forces and relations of production, and the global economy. Therefore, it is necessary that we technically, practically, and more broadly take an overview of Web3. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of Web3, with a focus on current technologies, challenges, opportunities, and outlook. This article first introduces several major technologies of Web3. Then, we illustrate the type of Web3 applications in detail. Blockchain and smart contracts ensure that decentralized organizations will be less trusted and more truthful than that centralized organizations. Decentralized finance will be global, and open with financial inclusiveness for unbanked people. This paper also discusses the relationship between the Metaverse and Web3, as well as the differences and similarities between Web 3.0 and Web3. Inspired by the Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory, we further conduct a novel hierarchy of needs theory within Web3. Finally, several worthwhile future research directions of Web3 are discussed.},

@article{lerner_government_2000,
	abstract = {Government programs that finance small firms have attracted little empirical attention. This article examines the largest U.S. initiative, the Small Business Innovation Research program. Using a unique database, this article shows that SBIR awardees grew significantly faster than matched firms over a decade and were more likely to attract venture financing. The superior performance of awardees was confined to firms in regions with substantial venture capital activity and was particularly pronounced in high-technology industries. Multiple awards did not increase performance. These results suggest that awards played an important role in certifying firm quality, but also that distortions of the award process do occur.},

	abstract = {Governments regularly subsidize new ventures to spur innovation. This paper conducts the first large-sample, quasi-experimental evaluation of R\&D subsidies. I use data on ranked applicants to the US Department of Energy's SBIR grant program. An early-stage award approximately doubles the probability that a firm receives subsequent venture capital and has large, positive impacts on patenting and revenue. These effects are stronger for more financially constrained firms. Certification, where the award contains information about firm quality, likely does not explain the grant effect. Instead, the grants are useful because they fund technology prototyping.},

@misc{wang_self-sovereign_2020,
	abstract = {After introducing key concepts and definitions in the field of digital identity, this paper will investigate the benefits and drawbacks of existing identity systems on the road towards achieving self-sovereign identity. It will explore, in particular, the use of blockchain technology and biometrics as a means to ensure the ``unicity'' and ``singularity'' of identities, and the associated challenges pertaining to the security and confidentiality of personal information. The paper will then describe an alternative approach to self-sovereign identity based on a system of blockchain-based attestations, claims, credentials and permissions, which are globally portable across the life of an individual. While not dependent on any particular government or organization for administration or legitimacy, credentials and attestations might nonetheless include government-issued identification and biometrics as one of many indicia of identity. Such a solution---based on a recorded and signed digital history of attributes and activities---best approximates the fluidity and granularity of identity, enabling individuals to express only specific facets of their identity, depending on the parties with whom they wish to interact. To illustrate the difficulties inherent in the implementation of a self-sovereign identity system in the real world, the paper will focus on two blockchain-based identity solutions as case studies: (1) Kiva's identity protocol for building credit history in Sierra Leone, and (2) World Food Programme's Building Blocks program for delivering cash aid to refugees in Jordan. Finally, the paper will explore how the combination of blockchain-based cryptocurrencies and self-sovereign identity may contribute to promoting greater economic inclusion. With digital transactions functioning as identity claims within an ecosystem based on self-sovereign identity, new business models might emerge, such as identity insurance schemes, along with the emergence of value-stable cryptocurrencies (``stablecoins'') functioning as local currencies.},

This article compares, contrasts, and critiques the transition policies of the top health donors in the Asia Pacific, which includes Global Fund to fight AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria, Gavi--the Vaccine Alliance, World Bank (International Development Association), and the United States US Agency for International Development to gain a deeper understanding of what a sustainable financial transition could look like. A literature review of the academic and gray literature was undertaken to ascertain these donors' transition policies and to determine the success of these policies in ensuring sustainable and effective transition. It is proposed that sustainable transition requires a clearly articulated vision of long-term impact, explicit and transparent transition policies, clear time frames for transition, donor coordination, and evaluation of long-term impacts of donor withdrawal.},

There are numerous developments that speak to the practical details of contemporary public management. Five key findings are (1) information technology needs are challenging states, with some responding well, but others struggling, (2) in most states staff training needs to be improved, (3) restrictions prohibiting ``best value'' purchasing need to be removed, (4) states can learn from and improve practices by partnering with other governments and private organizations, and (5) most states use a hybrid of both centralized and decentralized management structures when it comes to contracting and procurement.},

@misc{biedermann_evaluating_2024,
	abstract = {This report introduces the Grant Maturity Index (GMI), a novel evaluative framework designed to assess the maturity and operational effectiveness of Web3 grant programs. As Web3 continues to develop, the decentralized nature of these programs brings both opportunities and challenges, particularly when it comes to governance, transparency, and community engagement. Traditional funding models are often governed by standardized processes, but Web3 grants lack such consistency, making it difficult for grant operators to measure the long-term success of their programs.The Grant Maturity Index (GMI) was created through exploratory applied research to address this gap. Inspired by the World Bank's GovTech Maturity Index (GTMI), the GMI is tailored specifically for the decentralized Web3 ecosystem. The GMI evaluates key dimensions of grant programs governance, transparency, operational efficiency, and community engagement, providing grant operators with a clear benchmark for assessing and improving their programs. The primary objectives of this research are to, first, identify the structural indicators that adequately describe Web3 grant programs. Second, to describe optimal outcomes for programs by evaluating their maturity across key operational areas. The GMI is applied to four major Ethereum Layer 2 grant programs, namely Arbitrum, Mantle, Taiko Labs, and Optimism. These case studies highlight areas where Web3 grant programs require improvement, particularly in standardizing processes, enhancing transparency, and increasing community participation.},

@article{odewole_capital_2020,
	abstract = {The study investigated the efficiency of capital fund utilization among federal educational institutions as Decision Making Units (DMUs) in the education sector in Nigeria. Secondary data were sourced from the Annual General Warrants from the office of the Accountant- General of the Federation, Office of the Auditor-General of the federation, and Audited financial statements of the Public Sector entities. The sample size of the study comprised twenty-five (25) DMUs out of the population of fifty-five (55) from major Federal Ministries of education of four (4) geopolitical Zones and Abuja. Data were analyzed using Data Envelopment Analysis Model (DEA). The results of the average efficiency scores from both Banker, Charnes, and Cooper (BCC) and Charnes, Cooper, and Rhodes Model (CCR) on the DMUs showed that the sector was marginally inefficient. The summary of the overall results therefore revealed that the DMUs under the education sector performed averagely well in the utilization of capital grants allocations with the application of both CCR and BCC models. The study recommended that a central monitoring team be set up jointly by the Federal Ministry of Finance and Accountant-General's office to ensure full utilization of capital fund releases to the DMUs. Only the continuous assessment and periodic appraisal of the capital grants utilization by the central authority can guarantee full efficiency and flatten the curve of inefficiency in the utilization of capital grant releases among the federal educational institutions in Nigeria.},

It is suggested that the planning, organizing, and controlling activities associated with managing the computer resource will change in character over a period of time, and will evolve in patterns roughly correlated to four stages of the computer budget: Stage I (computer acquisition), Stage II (intense system development), Stage III (proliferation of controls), and Stage IV (user/service orientation). Each stage is described and related to individual tasks for managing the computer resource.},

@techreport{holmstrom_agency_1989,
	abstract = {Stylized facts indicate that small firms are responsible for a disproportionate share of innovative research. There are many possible explanations for this facto The paper seeks to understand this phenomena as the outcome of an optimal assignment of tasks across individuals and organizations. It is shown that incentive costs associated with a given task depend on the total portfolio of tasks that an individual or an organization undertakes. Mixing, hard to measure activities (innovation) with easy to measure activities (routine) is particularly costly, since it will either lead to misallocation of attention across tasks or to misallocation of risk. Larger firms are at a comparative disadvantage in conducting highly innovative research, because of the costs associated with managing a heterogeneous set of tasks. It is further argued that optimal organizational responses to coordination and control of routine tasks will lead to bureaucratization within the firm and to financial constraints imposed by capital markets, both of which are hostile to innovation.},

@article{sun_understanding_2004,
	abstract = {It is argued that univariate long memory estimates based on ex post data tend to underestimate the persistence of ex ante variables (and, hence, that of the ex post variables themselves) because of the presence of unanticipated shocks whose short-run volatility masks the degree of long-range dependence in the data. Empirical estimates of long-range dependence in the Fisher equation are shown to manifest this problem and lead to an apparent imbalance in the memory characteristics of the variables in the Fisher equation. Evidence in support of this typical underestimation is provided by results obtained with inflation forecast survey data and by direct calculation of the finite sample biases. To address the problem of bias, the paper introduces a bivariate exact Whittle (BEW) estimator that explicitly allows for the presence of short memory noise in the data. The new procedure enhances the empirical capacity to separate low-frequency behaviour from high-frequency fluctuations, and it produces estimates of long-range dependence that are much less biased when there is noise contaminated data. Empirical estimates from the BEW method suggest that the three Fisher variables are integrated of the same order, with memory parameter in the range (0.75, 1). Since the integration orders are balanced, the ex ante real rate has the same degree of persistence as expected inflation, thereby furnishing evidence against the existence of a (fractional) cointegrating relation among the Fisher variables and, correspondingly, showing little support for a long-run form of Fisher hypothesis.

@article{edler_connecting_2016,
	abstract = {Intermediation in innovation serves to establish or improve the link between different actors with complementary skill sets or interests in order to support the generation and diffusion of innovation. This article conceptualises and analyses intermediation between supply and demand using the example of public procurement of innovation. It defines specific intermediation needs and functions in different procurement situations and outlines the pre-condition for effective intermediation. The paper combines and contributes to the growing literature on innovation intermediation and public procurement of innovation. As the paper looks at the demand for innovation it adopts a broad understanding of innovation, defined as a product, service or process that is novel to the buying organisation. In order to develop the conceptualisation of intermediation in the process of demanding innovation, it builds on the existing, rather rudimentary conceptualisation of intermediation in the innovation and management literature. It presents an in-depth analysis of two very different procurement processes in two cases in a complex public sector setting, the English NHS, case of a public buying organisation triggering the generation of an innovation, and another in which an organisation sought to respond to an innovation offered in the marketplace. In both cases, the solution bought necessitated strong adaptation processes with considerable learning costs within the buying organisation. The paper shows how intelligent and tailored intermediation can tackle some of the well-known procedural and capability failures in the process of public procurement of innovation. In terms of policy implications, the article makes the claim for an increased effort to build up effective intermediation across procurement systems to support agencies in concrete procurement and, in doing so, to build up capacity for more intelligent public buying. While the focus on intermediation responds to an existing gap in the literature on public procurement of innovation, the paper has implication for demand-supply intermediation more generally.},

@article{sanchez-pinto_emerging_2017,
	abstract = {Background: 
The role of the Chief Research Informatics Officer (CRIO) is emerging in academic health centers to address the challenges clinical researchers face in the increasingly digitalized, data-intensive healthcare system. Most current CRIOs are the first officers in their institutions to hold that role. To date there is very little published information about this role and the individuals who serve it.

Objective:
To increase our understanding of the CRIO role, the leaders who serve it, and the factors associated with their success in their organizations.

Methods:
The Clinical Research Informatics Working Group of the American Medical Informatics Association (AMIA) conducted a national survey of CRIOs in the United States and convened an expert panel of CRIOs to discuss their experience during the 2016 AMIA Annual Symposium.

Results:
CRIOs come from diverse academic backgrounds. Most have advance training and extensive experience in biomedical informatics but the majority have been CRIOs for less than three years. CRIOs identify funding, data governance, and advancing data analytics as their major challenges.

Conclusion:
CRIOs play an important role in helping shape the future of clinical research, innovation, and data analytics in healthcare in their organizations. They share many of the same challenges and see the same opportunities for the future of the field. Better understanding the background and experience of current CRIOs can help define and develop the role in other organizations and enhance their influence in the field of research informatics.},

	abstract = {The review discusses the political-economic aspects of the concept of distributed capitalism allowed for by blockchain technology. As opposed to the first era of the Internet, where the industry of financial and information services was dominated by intermediaries, the blockchain era is characterized by development of a new institution of trust; disruption of financial intermediation; economic inclusion of hundreds of millions of citizens in developing countries; an increase in competition and a decrease in inequality. The paper focuses on the content of key political-economic categories being redefined in the blockchain era. First, labor value gives way to creative value which is manifesting itself in cryptocurrencies. Second, exploitation of workers is replaced by digital discrimination. The blockchain revolution is a solution to the problem of discrimination against intellectual property creators, who have to hand over a large part of the value created to intermediaries. Third, capitalism characterized by information monopoly gives place to free competition based on rivalry between cryptocurrencies. Fourth, class struggle is substituted by confrontation between agents of information monopoly system and those of distributed economy. The author considers the main opposition to distributed capitalism to stem from the feudal financial system which loses ground under new conditions, where economic agents may use alternative currencies and interact directly with one other without risk and high transaction costs.},

@article{yatskovskaya_integrated_2018,
	abstract = {Today's supply chains (SCs) are more than ever prone to disruptions caused by natural and man-made events with water scarcity identified as one of the highest impact events among these. Leading businesses, understanding that natural resource scarcity (NRS) has become a critical supply chain risk factor, extensively incorporate sustainable water management programmes into their corporate social responsibility and environmental management agenda. The question of how industries can efficiently evaluate the progress of these water scarcity mitigation practices, however, remains open. In order to address this question, the present study proposes a conceptual maturity model. The model is rooted in strategies for water scarcity mitigation using a framework developed by Yatskovskaya and Srai and develops an extensive literature review of recent publications on maturity frameworks in the fields of sustainability and operations management. In order to test the proposed proposed, model an exploratory case study with a leading pharmaceutical company was conducted. The proposed maturity model presents an evaluation tool that allows systematic assessment and visualisation of organisational routines and practices relevant to sustainable manufacturing in the context of water scarcity. This model was designed to help illustrate mitigation capabilities evolution over time, where future state desired capabilities were considered through alternative supply network (SN) configurations, network structure, process flow, product architecture, and supply partnerships.},

@article{knosp_research_2018,
	abstract = {This paper proposes the creation and application of maturity models to guide institutional strategic investment in research informatics and information technology (research IT) and to provide the ability to measure readiness for clinical and research infrastructure as well as sustainability of expertise. Conducting effective and efficient research in health science increasingly relies upon robust research IT systems and capabilities. Academic health centers are increasing investments in health IT systems to address operational pressures, including rapidly growing data, technological advances, and increasing security and regulatory challenges associated with data access requirements. Current approaches for planning and investment in research IT infrastructure vary across institutions and lack comparable guidance for evaluating investments, resulting in inconsistent approaches to research IT implementation across peer academic health centers as well as uncertainty in linking research IT investments to institutional goals. Maturity models address these issues through coupling the assessment of current organizational state with readiness for deployment of potential research IT investment, which can inform leadership strategy. Pilot work in maturity model development has ranged from using them as a catalyst for engaging medical school IT leaders in planning at a single institution to developing initial maturity indices that have been applied and refined across peer medical schools.},

@article{beck_governance_2018,
	abstract = {Blockchain technology is often referred to as a groundbreaking innovation and the harbinger of a new economic era. Blockchains may be capable of engendering a new type of economic system: the blockchain economy. In the blockchain economy, agreed-upon transactions would be enforced autonomously, following rules defined by smart contracts. The blockchain economy would manifest itself in a new form of organizational design---decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO)---which are organizations with governance rules specified in the blockchain. We discuss the blockchain economy along dimensions defined in the IT governance literature: decision rights, accountability, and incentives. Our case study of a DAO illustrates that governance in the blockchain economy may depart radically from established notions of governance. Using the three governance dimensions, we propose a novel IT governance framework and a research agenda for governance in the blockchain economy. We challenge common assumptions in the blockchain discourse, and propose promising information systems research related to these assumptions.},

@article{parino_analysis_2018,
	abstract = {As the first decentralized digital currency introduced in 2009 together with the blockchain, Bitcoin offers new opportunities both for developed and developing countries. Bitcoin peer-to-peer transactions are independent of the banking system, facilitating foreign exchanges with low transaction fees, such as remittances, and offering a high degree of anonymity. These opportunities together with other key factors led the Bitcoin to become extremely popular and caused its price to skyrocket during 2017 (Henry et al. in J Digit Bank 2(4):311--337, 2018). However, while the Bitcoin blockchain attracts a lot of attention, it remains difficult to investigate where this attention comes from, due to the pseudo-anonymity of the system, and consequently to appreciate its social impact. Here we make an attempt to characterize the adoption of the Bitcoin blockchain by country. In the first part of the work we show that information about the number of Bitcoin software client downloads, the IP addresses that act as relays for the transactions, and the Internet searches about Bitcoin provide together a coherent picture of the system evolution in different countries. Using these quantities as a proxy for user adoption, we identify several socio-economic indexes such as the GDP per capita, freedom of trade and the Internet penetration as key variables correlated with the degree of user adoption. In the second part of the work, we build a network of Bitcoin transactions between countries using the IP addresses of nodes relaying transactions and we develop an augmented version of the gravity model of trade in order to identify socio-economic factors linked to the flow of Bitcoin between countries. In a nutshell our study provides a new insight on Bitcoin adoption by country and on the potential socio-economic drivers of the international Bitcoin flow.},

	abstract = {Decentralized autonomy is a long-standing research topic in information sciences and social sciences. The self-organization phenomenon in natural ecosystems, the Cyber Movement Organizations (CMOs) on the Internet, and the Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI), and so on, can all be regarded as its early manifestations. In recent years, the rapid development of blockchain technology has spawned the emergence of the so-called Decentralized Autonomous Organization [DAO, sometimes labeled as Decentralized Autonomous Corporation (DAC)], which is a new organization form that the management and operational rules are typically encoded on blockchain in the form of smart contracts, and can autonomously operate without centralized control or third-party intervention. DAO is expected to overturn the traditional hierarchical management model and significantly reduce organizations' costs on communication, management, and collaboration. However, DAO still faces many challenges, such as security and privacy issue, unclear legal status, and so on. In this article, we strive to present a systematic introduction of DAO, including its concept and characteristics, research framework, typical implementations, challenges, and future trends. Especially, a novel reference model for DAO which employs a five-layer architecture is proposed. This article is aimed at providing helpful guidance and reference for future research efforts.},

	abstract = {The tender process is a long and complex business process to produce a series of legal obligations related to business contracts. The purpose of conducting a tender in government is to support the work program by finding the right tender (provider of goods and services) in the government procurement program so that it can be the basis of their decision to choose the most suitable tender. At the government in Indonesia, the tender process has been carried out using an e-tendering system with the use of internet technology through LPSE. The purpose of e-tendering is to facilitate the procurement process with related parties to increase productivity, effectiveness, and transparency in the tender process. However, problems in the e-tendering system are currently centralized, so that the local LPSE organization has full control of the database and the system which can pose a threat of vulnerability to fraud, collusion, and manipulation practices. The tender selection process that is full of competition must be supported by effective and transparent technology so that it does not cause fraud and suspicion among bidders. Blockchain technology is one of the solutions that allow integrated systems without a third party because it adheres to the decentralized nature of distributed databases so that it has a copy of many users. By adopting blockchain e-tendering can reduce the source of fraud, namely database manipulation. This research will explore the process of developing a blockchain-based system with e-tendering case studies on LPSE.},

A literature review resulted in six theoretical areas related to communication maturity: understanding, function, organization, prerequisites, competence and practices including assessments of communication. These were analyzed in a qualitative comparative case study including 85 key stakeholders from eleven organizations. Findings illustrated the relevance of the theoretical areas to stakeholders' perceptions of their respective organizations' communication maturity. A first version of a Communication Maturity Index including four levels of maturity; immature, emerging, established, and mature is proposed. Based on the qualitative analysis, organizations' communication maturity levels varied from emerging to mature. Findings of this study are limited to participating organizations and interviewed stakeholders. The CMI can be further developed in quantitative studies to investigate the constitutive role of communication in organizations and to be used in practice to develop higher levels of communication maturity.},

It was proposed, as objective of this study, to evaluate the occupational risks to which the workers of the intensive care units are exposed. This was a descriptive-analytical, cross-sectional, observational, where the working conditions of workers in the intensive care units of the Coimbra county hospitals were evaluated. The risk assessments identified multiple risk factors in the intensive care units under study and showed the most incidental risks are those of biological and ergonomic origin. The analytical studies showed unsatisfactory results in some parameters when compared with the legislated values. It is concluded that the work in intensive care units presents multiple and constant risk factors, in which it is evident that the most prevalent are biological and ergonomic risks, however, in order to explain the probability of the damage it is necessary to point out that the exposure is related to the time spent on the tasks.},

The main objective of maturity models is to evaluate and improve the organization's practices by creating an improvement roadmap. However, the utilization of the methodologies and methods by this community for the development of this kind of tools is not consensual. Several investigators have created guidelines for the development of maturity models, but the authors are not adopting them; they prefer to adopt their own methodologies. In this research, with the objective of reviewing the methodologies, methods, and guidelines used by the scientific community to develop IT maturity models, a Systematic Literature Review and a Critical analysis were made in order to realize a comparison between IT maturity models and Non-IT maturity models. In total, 109 articles of maturity models' development were analyzed. A discussion of the articles' results was realized.},

@inproceedings{goswami_e-governance_2020,
	abstract = {E-governance, i.e., the use of information technology for government activities to provide services, exchange information, etc. are becoming increasingly popular. One such area of e-governance is e-tendering. While e-tendering makes the tendering process more efficient, a trust deficit remains between the citizens and the government, due to the centralized management of the whole tendering process. Several research works provide a decentralized solution to make the process of e-tendering more secure, transparent, and fair. However, in the present time, the government posts the problems/issues currently they are dealing with; and seems interested in taking the suggestions from the citizens to make the better solution for the problem. Thus, in this paper, a permissioned blockchain-based approach to provide a transparent and fair tendering system with citizens' active participation and tracking of funds is presented. In the proposed scheme, the citizens can see the tendering activities transparently and give ideas and suggestions to solve the government's posted problems and receive a due credit of that contribution is a fair manner.},

@book{dener_govtech_2021,
	abstract = {Governments have been using technology to modernize the public sector for decades. The World Bank Group (WBG) has been a partner in this process, providing both financing and technical assistance to facilitate countries' digital transformation journeys since the 1980s. The WBG launched the GovTech Initiative in 2019 to support the latest generation of these reforms. Over the past five years, developing countries have increasingly requested WBG support to design even more advanced digital transformation programs. These programs will help to increase government efficiency and improve the access to and the quality of service delivery, provide more government-to-citizen and government-to-business communications, enhance transparency and reduce corruption, improve governance and oversight, and modernize core government operations. The GovTech Initiative appropriately responds to this growing demand. The GovTech Maturity Index (GTMI) measures the key aspects of four GovTech focus areas---supporting core government systems, enhancing service delivery, mainstreaming citizen engagement, and fostering GovTech enablers---and assists advisers and practitioners in the design of new digital transformation projects. Constructed for 198 economies using consistent data sources, the GTMI is the most comprehensive measure of digital transformation in the public sector. Several similar indices and indicators are available in the public domain to measure aspects of digital government---including the United Nations e-Government Development Index, the WBG's Digital Adoption Index, and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Digital Government Index. These indices, however, do not fully capture the aspects of emphasis in the GovTech approach---the whole-of-government approach and citizen centricity---as key when assessing the use of digital solutions for public sector modernization. The GTMI is not intended to be an assessment of readiness or performance; rather, it is intended to complement the existing tools and diagnostics by providing a baseline and a benchmark for GovTech maturity and by offering insights to those areas that have room for improvement. The GTMI is designed to be used by practitioners, policy makers, and task teams involved in the design of digital transformation strategies and individual projects, as well as by those who seek to understand their own practices and learn from those of others.},

	abstract = {Corruption takes place in public procurement by public servants through intermediaries due to the use of centralized systems and complicated processes. Blockchain and Web3 has the potential to remove these intermediaries, instead allowing institutions to build trust among public servants and citizens through a decentralized web. It is feasible to positively reinforce the transparency in tackling corruption in public procurement by establishing an e-participatory governance infrastructure using token economics from smart-contract blockchain technology. The overall success of public procurement in terms of service delivery to citizens is associated with citizen e-participation. Thus, increased e-participation through automated processes makes the government accountable and transparent in the provision of services that lead to the progress and economic growth of a country. In this paper, we investigate the potential of blockchain and smart-contracts to improve the efficiency, trust, and transparency of public procurement in the case of Afghanistan. Moreover, we identify the existing barriers namely lack of trust, transparency, the complexity of procurement documents, and inappropriate record-keeping system. To address these issues, we propose a blockchain-based e-participatory infrastructure to boost transparency by curbing public procurement corruption.},

	abstract = {Purpose This research analyzes the current knowledge regarding the use of maturity models (MMs) in SSCM, aiming to identify the main characteristics, trends and research gaps on the subject. Facing the growing interest in carrying out studies directed at sustainability, to the detriment of more prescient environmental and social impacts and the need to consolidate the concepts present in the literature regarding the SSCM, an absence of similar studies in the current literature was found. The authors have selected articles to compose a database that allows users to analyze and classify publications on MMs in SSCM, being those subdivided into 7 categories: focus, methodology, analyzed sector, sustainable practices, dimensions of sustainable development, type of MM and model/framework validation method. Design/methodology/approach To achieve this purpose, a literature systematization was conducted by searching publications using defined keywords in two databases and following a process of classification. The systematic process has five steps, from the selection of databases to the filtering of publications, review of information and analysis of the sample. Findings The topic under study is promising, with a few publications dealing with it, mainly in Brazil, and there is a trend to exploit more of the area in future research. Originality/value This research provides a detailed analysis of an emerging theme, divided into seven thematic categories. Results demonstrate that the topic is still underexplored, indicating an important research gap to be filled.},

@misc{allen_exchange_2022,
	abstract = {Blockchains have enabled innovation in distributed economic institutions, such as money (e.g., cryptocurrencies) and markets (e.g., decentralised exchanges), but also innovations in distributed governance, such as decentralised autonomous organisations (DAOs). These innovations have generated academic interest in studying web3 governance, but as yet there is no general theory of web3 governance. In this paper we draw on the contrast between a `romantic view' of governance (characterised by consensus through community voting) and the `exchange view' of governance (characterised by an entrepreneurial process of bargaining and exchange of voters under uncertainty) from public choice theory. Our analysis is the first to argue that the latter `exchange view' of governance is best to understand the dynamics of governance innovation in web3, and provides the foundations for a new general theory of governance in this frontier field. We apply the exchange lens of governance to three case studies (Curve, Lido and Metagov), exploring how these projects enable pseudonymous, composable, and permissionless governance processes to reveal value. The exchange lens also helps illuminate how this emergent polycentric process can generate robustness in decentralised systems.},

@article{ding_desci_2022,
	abstract = {Decentralized science (DeSci) is a hot topic emerging with the development of Web3 or Web3.0 and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) and operations. DeSci fundamentally differs from the centralized science (CeSci) and Open Science (OS) movement built in the centralized way with centralized protocols. It changes the basic structure and legacy norms of current scientific systems via reshaping the cooperation mode, value system, and incentive mechanism. As such, it can provide a viable path for solving bottleneck problems in the development of science, such as oligarchy, silos, and so on, and make science more fair, free, responsible, and sensitive. However, DeSci itself still faces many challenges, including scaling, balancing the quality of participants, system suboptimal loops, lack of accountability mechanism, and so on. Taking these into consideration, this article presents a systematic introduction of DeSci, proposes a novel reference model with a six-layer architecture, addresses the potential applications, and also outlines the key research directions in this emerging field. This article is committed to providing helpful guidance and reference for future research efforts on DeSci.},

	abstract = {nformation technology is the backbone for all 21st 
-century organizations that are looking  
forward to offering better customer service and gaining a competitive advantage. Today,  
the blockchain technology is being adopted by several organizations such as financial  
service providers, healthcare, agriculture, and even government sectors. Nonetheless, the  
procurement sector has adopted information technology in its processes especially with  
the advent of E-procurement technology. However, the tendering sector has not been able  
to take advantage of the new blockchain technology. This study focuses on the  
blockchain and its BYOE (Bring Your Own Encryption) concept in the procurement  
sector. Using a proof of concept approach the research came up with a blockchain-based  
procurement model for organizations. The model was designed following ASD approach.  
While Ethereum based solidity smart contract with Truffle running on 127.0.0.1:9545 and  
MetaMask installation was configured for the running environment. In addition, Ganache  
running on localhost 127.0.0.1:7545 for the graphical interface was realized. The running  
hosted model is available at https://gov.chimera-iot.co.ke/index.php. The model  
prototype was evaluated based on the model goals and software quality attributes.  
Software quality attributes, was a purely technical evaluation that used test cases to see if  
the model requirements were attained. To ascertain the model goals, the evaluation  
intended to identify issues related to the various model components and gauge user  
experience. At the end of the evaluation process, the functional testing proved that all the  
model functional and system requirements were satisfied. The feedback from the users  
also indicated that most of the participants were able to accomplish all the model  
functionalities. Participants also strongly agreed that the model satisfied all the goals and  
software quality attributes. The model verification and validation results showed that the  
model design satisfied all the intended objectives. The model was able to automatically  
initiate the tender, place bid and perform bid evaluation \& relay bid results with relevant  
bid reports. The functional model was able to provide transparencies by ensuring bids are  
not concealed and ensuring immutability of transaction thus ensuring transparency and  
openness. The overall idea was therefore found to be feasible and practical},

	abstract = {The performance of green marketing refers to the realistic state of green marketing activities in terms of enterprise development, consumer demand and social ecological environment. These aspects are represented by the game equilibrium between green marketing subjects. The better the game equilibrium between green marketing subjects, the better the performance of green marketing. In the real market environment, this ideal balance is often broken, and green marketing activities are difficult to carry out normally, affecting the performance of green marketing. At the same time, the characteristics of green marketing performance have its particularity. On the one hand, green marketing performance cannot be formed in a short time. Once good performance is formed, this performance can play a role in a long time; On the other hand, there are many factors involved, and the quality of performance not only depends on the improvement of the social ecological environment, but also includes the achievement of enterprise goals and consumer satisfaction. The enterprise green marketing performance management evaluation is a classical multiple attribute decision making (MADM). Recently, the TODIM and TOPSIS method has been used to cope with MADM issues. The triangular fuzzy neutrosophic sets (TFNSs) are used as a tool for characterizing uncertain information during the enterprise green marketing performance management evaluation. In this manuscript, the triangular fuzzy neutrosophic TODIM-TOPSIS (TFN-TODIM-TOPSIS) method is built to solve the MADM under TFNSs. In the end, a numerical case study for enterprise green marketing performance management evaluation is given to validate the proposed method.},

The grant agreement may stipulate that the consortium of stakeholders will need to continue after the end of the project, but in such a way that it is possible to make decisions and benefit from the projec's results. Choosing a specific option implies that the consortium will have an entity. This raises considerable complications, as it requires consultation with the legal departments of the consortium partners and the construction of numerous links between the partners, mainly if the jointly developed solution consists of components produced by a different partner each time. The paper, therefore, put a creative solution - why not leave the nature of the social movement to the scientific project, and write the relationships between stakeholders and decision-making into the programming code? To answer this question, we present the state of the law related to DAOs and review the literature on whether the direction to apply this type of solution in smart factories is appropriate.},

	abstract = {Purpose The aim of the article is to determine research areas and to recognize the current direction in the development of maturity models, to indicate the key areas of organizational maturity models (OMMs) development and their classification as well as to pinpoint research gaps and areas of potential development of OMMs in the context of scientific research and the needs of management practitioners. Design/methodology/approach The research was conducted using the literature review method, bibliometric analysis and visual mappings. Findings The empirical classification developed in this paper identified 12 categories based on management areas, constituting the criteria for classifying OMMs models, where OMMs are being developed: Information Technology, Project Management, Business Management and Strategy, Human Resource, Ergonomics, Health and Safety Management, Industry 4.0 concept, Knowledge Management, Process Management, Performance Management, Quality Management, Supply Chain Management, Risk Management and Innovation Management. Research limitations/implications The main limitation is the analysis in the scope of topic OMMs including solely the Scopus and Thompson Reuters Web of Science database. Another shortcoming is conducting data analysis and classification based on the abstracts of the selected articles. Originality/value This work is a starting point to prospect trends for future revolving around the OMMs crossing different databases.},

The proposed solution addresses the GSMA's second (of four) circularity challenges for the telecommunications industry: optimizing the sourcing, reusing, and repurposing of existing network equipment by reducing fragmentation and friction in the global used equipment market via auctions. These auctions are fully digitalized via smart contracts and blockchain assures full transparency. The decentralized solution is governed by a non-profit coalition of firms and operated on a service-at-cost basis.},

	abstract = {Blockchain has been recognised as a technological breakthrough with the ability to support new decentralised security-based solutions in sectors such as information technology and finance. Blockchain allows different communities to create Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs), which are self-organised democratic organisations controlled by smart contracts. This paper presents a new DAO model for the procurement of services by public organisations, such as government agencies. To demonstrate the advantages of this solution, this work looks specifically at current public procurement systems that resort to third-party contractors that manage these negotiations. Third parties lack the transparency, security, and democratic representation that a DAO can provide. We present the implementation of a DAO as a set of smart contracts executed on Ethereum-compatible permissionless blockchains, supported by a consensus algorithm, replacing third-party contractors.},

	abstract = {Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) use smart contracts to foster communities working toward common goals. Existing definitions of decentralization, however-the 'D' in DAO-fall short of capturing key properties characteristic of diverse and equitable participation. We propose a new metric called Voting-Bloc Entropy (VBE, pronounced ''vibe'') that formalizes a broad notion of decentralization in voting on DAO proposals. VBE measures the similarity of participants' utility functions across a set of proposals. We use VBE to prove a number of results about the decentralizing effects of vote delegation, proposal bundling, bribery, and quadratic voting. Our results lead to practical suggestions for enhancing DAO decentralization. One of our results highlights the risk of systemic bribery with increasing DAO decentralization. To show that this threat is realistic, we present the first practical realization of a Dark DAO, a proposed mechanism for privacy-preserving corruption of identity systems, including those used in DAO voting. Our Dark-DAO prototype uses trusted execution environments (TEEs) in the Oasis Sapphire blockchain for attacks on Ethereum DAOs. It demonstrates that Dark DAOs constitute a realistic future concern for DAO governance.},

	abstract = {Corruption and lack of transparency remain critical challenges in governance systems around the world. These issues are often perpetuated by centralized systems and their manipulation by system administrators. Furthermore, the lack of data ownership and the monetization of user data by tech companies further increase concerns about transparency. In light of these concerns, this study aims to review existing blockchain-based governance models and identify best-practice governance models focusing on corruption transparency, their characteristics, and components. The research will also examine the role of a token economy in addressing trusted third-party issues related to asset ownership management. Furthermore, we discuss the effect of smart contracts, blockchain, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO), Web 3.0, and multifactor challenge set self-sovereign identity authentication (MFSSIA) as modern technologies to combat corruption and achieve transparency in the public sector. To achieve this, we conduct a systematic literature review (SLR) comprising peer-reviewed journals, proceedings, and book chapters published between 2012 and 2023. Using the SLR methodology, 45 primary and supporting studies have been selected for result extraction and analysis. Finally, we discovered seven blockchain-based governance models with their characteristics and primary components.},

@article{wang_novel_2024,
	abstract = {This article proposes a novel parallel management mode based on decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) for enterprises by utilizing the artificial systems, computational experiments, parallel execution (ACP) approach, parallel intelligence theory, and blockchain technologies, to realize the distributed management of an enterprise. The artificial enterprise DAO (EnDAO) corresponding to the actual enterprise is constructed, and they constitute a parallel system via virtual--real interaction and parallel execution. Through the non-fungible token (NFT)-based incentive mechanism, metaverse-based virtual learning and training, as well as DAO-based distributed management and decision-making, the management and control of the actual enterprise as well as its employees can be carried out. By virtue of the virtual--real interactions of three types of employees, as well as the virtual--real feedback of three closed loops in the parallel systems, DAO-based parallel management for enterprises can realize descriptive intelligence, predictive intelligence, and prescriptive intelligence. On this basis, this article takes the recruitment-oriented key performance indicator (KPI) management of a startup technology enterprise as the case to introduce the operation processes and illustrate the superiorities of the proposed DAO-based enterprise parallel management mode.},

@article{nguyen_penchain_2024,
	abstract = {Service provisioning is of paramount importance as we are now heading towards a world of integrated services giving rise to the next generation of service ecosystems. The huge number of service offerings that will be available to customers in future scenarios require a novel approach to service registry and discovery that allows customers to choose the offerings that best match their preferences. One way to achieve this is to introduce the provider's reputation, i.e., a quality indicator of the provisioned service, as an additional search criterion. Now, with blockchain technology in our hands, automated regulation of service-level agreements (SLAs) that capture mutual agreements between all involved parties has regained momentum. In this article, we report on our full-fledged work on the conception, design, and construction of a platform for SLA-minded service provisioning called PenChain. With our work, we demonstrate that penalty-aware SLAs of general services--if represented in machine-readable logic and assisted by distributed ledger technology--are programmatically enforceable. We devise algorithms for ranking services in a search result taking into account the digitized values of the SLAs. We offer two scenario-based evaluations of PenChain in the field of precision agriculture and in the domain of automotive manufacturing. Furthermore, we examine the scalability and data security of PenChain for precision agriculture.},

@misc{karakostas_sok_2024,
	abstract = {Decentralization has been touted as the principal security advantage which propelled blockchain systems at the forefront of developments in the financial technology space. Its exact semantics nevertheless remain highly contested and ambiguous, with proponents and critics disagreeing widely on the level of decentralization offered by existing systems. To address this, we put forth a systematization of the current landscape with respect to decentralization and we derive a methodology that can help direct future research towards defining and measuring decentralization. Our approach dissects blockchain systems into multiple layers, or strata, each possibly encapsulating multiple categories, and it enables a unified method for measuring decentralization in each one. Our layers are (1) hardware, (2) software, (3) network, (4) consensus, (5) economics ("tokenomics"), (6) client API, (7) governance, and (8) geography. Armed with this stratification, we examine for each layer which pertinent properties of distributed ledgers (safety, liveness, privacy, stability) can be at risk due to centralization and in what way. We also introduce a practical test, the "Minimum Decentralization Test" which can provide quick insights about the decentralization state of a blockchain system. To demonstrate how our stratified methodology can be used in practice, we apply it fully (layer by layer) to Bitcoin, and we provide examples of systems which comprise one or more "problematic" layers that cause them to fail the MDT. Our work highlights the challenges in measuring and achieving decentralization, and suggests various potential directions where future research is needed.},

	abstract = {Governance protocols define the means for amending or changing smart contracts without any centralized authority. They distribute the decision-making power to every user of the smart contract: Users vote on accepting or rejecting every change. In this work, we review and characterize decentralized governance in practice, using Compound and Uniswap -- two widely used governance protocols -- as a case study. We reveal a high concentration of voting power in both Compound and Uniswap: 10 voters hold together 57.86\% and 44.72\% of the voting power, respectively. Although proposals to change or amend the protocol receive, on average, a substantial number of votes (i.e., 89.39\%) in favor within the Compound protocol, they require fewer than three voters to obtain 50\% or more votes. We show that voting on Compound proposals can be unfairly expensive for small token holders, and we discover voting coalitions that can further marginalize these users.},
